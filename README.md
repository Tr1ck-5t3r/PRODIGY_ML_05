# Food and Calories Detection
## Introduction
This Jupyter Notebook is designed to analyze food items and estimate their caloric content using image data. The project aims to leverage computer vision techniques and machine learning models to identify food types and predict their calorie values. This can be particularly useful for applications in health and fitness tracking, dietary planning, and nutritional research.

## Dataset

[The dataset]([URL](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/kmader/food41))

The dataset used in this project consists of images of various food items along with their corresponding calorie information. The dataset includes:

-Images of different types of food items.
-Caloric content data associated with each food item.

The images are preprocessed and annotated to facilitate model training and evaluation. Details about the dataset, including its source, preprocessing steps, and structure, are provided within the notebook.

## Deliverables
The primary deliverables of this project include:

-Data Preprocessing: Scripts and steps to clean, annotate, and prepare the dataset for modeling.
-Model Training: Implementation of machine learning models to classify food items and predict their caloric content.
-Evaluation Metrics: Evaluation of model performance using appropriate metrics (e.g., accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score).
-Visualization: Visual representations of the results, such as confusion matrices, plots of training/validation loss, and accuracy curves.

## Results and Conclusion
The results section provides an overview of the model's performance on the test data, including accuracy and other relevant metrics. Key findings and insights derived from the analysis are discussed. The conclusion summarizes the effectiveness of the model in detecting food items and estimating their caloric content, highlighting any limitations and potential areas for future work.
